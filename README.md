# ol-sp (OpenLayers simple point)

A basic map using OpenLayers to generate a point. Can be embedded on custom sites.

This is mostly meant for my own use and isn't production ready.

## Configuration Examples

The following list is a list of files meant to help you embed this in your own website:

### Required files

- **Required**: [Example `index.html`](https://github.com/servedsmart/ol-sp/tree/main/index.html), I have added comments that show which files are required
- **Required**: [Example `config.js`](https://github.com/servedsmart/ol-sp/tree/main/src/config.js)
- **Required**: [Example `location-dot.svg`](https://github.com/servedsmart/ol-sp/tree/main/src/assets/icons/location-dot.svg)
- **Required**: Get `ol-sp.min.esm.js` from the npm package: `ol-sp`
- **Required**: Get `ol-sp.min.css` from the associated npm package: `ol-sp`
