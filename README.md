# ol-simple-point

A basic map using OpenLayers to generate a point. Can be embedded on custom sites.

This is mostly meant for my own use and isn't production ready.

## Configuration Examples

The following list is a list of files meant to help you embed this in your own website:

### Required files

- **Required**: [Example `index.html`](https://github.com/servedsmart/ol-simple-point/tree/main/index.html), I have added comments that show which files are required
